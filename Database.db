USER REVIEW: 1.Excellent movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was so interesting and thrillling. This is the best tamil movie of 2021. Excellant movie.
             2.I'm not a native tamil speaker but I had seen the film trailer which had intrigued me.

This film is what I call raw hitting. It hits where it hurts the cast did a great job the casting director did better job of finding such cast.

The direction of this film is very grounded it never feels like cliche so does the acting of all cast member.

The cinematography of the Film is very simple which gives it more of an indie film vibe .

As an Indian you should definitely watch this film because I haven't seen more important film than this in a decade.
